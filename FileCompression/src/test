WHY THE NFL SHOULD REMOVE MARIJUANA FROM ITS LIST OF BANNED SUBSTANCES

Introduction
Marijuana, its legality, and its medical benefits have been controversial topics since its classification as a Schedule 1 drug established by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. As a result, government funding for scientific research has been hard to come by which has hindered the efforts to reach legitimate conclusions about the physiological effects of marijuana usage. However, with the recent legalization of marijuana for medical use in the majority of states, there is mounting evidence to support that marijuana can play a significant role in many different aspects of modern life. Furthermore, marijuana can play an even more significant role in the lives of NFL players. This paper will examine key issues facing the NFL and discuss how marijuana can be incorporated in an effort to resolve or at least mitigate these problems. More specifically, this paper will delve into the issues of reckless pain management practices seen in the league and the prevalence of concussions with its subsequent side effects. Then, we will briefly discuss the possible legal and social benefits that the league could realize if marijuana were not so harshly criticized. In whole, this paper argues that the NFL should remove marijuana from its banned substance list as it can have a significant impact on pain management, has been shown to have neuroprotective properties, and can have positive effects on both the league and its athletes in relation to the legal realm. 

A brief history of marijuana in the United States
Marijuana has been consumed for its therapeutic effects since ancient times. The first direct documented reference to the herb was found in the writings of the Chinese emperor Shen Nung, dating back to 2737 BCE. In these times, cannabis was used for its desired effects as a medication for malaria, gout, rheumatism, and what the Chinese described as absent-mindedness. Marijuana was introduced into the New World in 1545 by Spanish settlers. In the early 1600’s, the English began cultivating the hemp plant as a primary commercial crop along with tobacco in the settlement of Jamestown . Toward the end of the 19th century, cotton had replaced hemp as the major cash crop in many southern states. However, by this time marijuana had already been used in several patented medicines. Cannabis was prescribed by physicians throughout the early 1900’s until the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 which effectively ended its use and sale. It is believed that this law was enacted in an effort to reduce the size of the hemp industry and preserve the interests of wealthy families. Although the tax act was ruled unconstitutional many years later, the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 took its place. This piece of legislation established rankings for substances based on their dangerousness and addictive potential. Marijuana was rated as a Schedule 1 drug alongside heroin and what is commonly referred to as “bath salts” while substances like cocaine and morphine were given only a Schedule 2 rating. Nixon signed this law into effect despite recommendations and reports that declared marijuana should not be assigned a Schedule 1 rating and even questioned its categorization as an illicit substance. Much of the hysteria surrounding marijuana was a product of government propaganda that saturated the media throughout the 1900’s. Some believe the government held steady in its stance as a means to control the Mexican population that spiked after the Mexican revolution . Marijuana gives an excuse to investigate areas densely populated with Mexicans and find reasons for deportation. However, in 1996, California became the first state to legalize marijuana for medical use, putting an end to the concept that it is an illicit substance with no medical value. Many states followed behind California, and today 28 states recognize medical marijuana as a legal substance while 7 states have passed laws allowing for its recreational use. 
Pain in the NFL
Pain is a natural and unavoidable aspect of all sports and is especially prominent in the NFL. Players are often told the best they will feel throughout the entire season is on the first day of camp. It is no surprise why this is the case. Players suffer repeated impacts throughout the course of a game and have to begin practicing for the following week’s game before they are fully recovered. This, coupled with a lifting program, puts constant stress on players’ bodies and tends to result in recurring body aches and pain. Furthermore, football is known for not only having one of the highest rates of injuries, but also one of the highest rates of serious injuries that require surgery or prolonged rehab . The nature of the game leaves many players in a state of constant or near-constant pain. However, these athletes regularly play through pain for fear of losing their jobs. The expendability of players motivates them to push through pain and injuries even if they are not entirely healthy. 

Current pain management practices
The job of an NFL team trainer is to ensure that players are able to perform on the field. If a player is injured, the trainer’s purpose is to get the athlete back onto the field as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, the profit seeking nature of owners and the league has led to illegitimate medical practices within the NFL. The default strategy for teams across the league has been to simply numb the pain and put the player on the field instead of addressing the root of the pain. This is done primarily with prescription pain relievers which are handed out to players illegally by the training staff. There is typically no effort in developing a diagnosis. Once everybody is settled in and ready to travel after games, common practice is for the training staff to ask “Who needs something?” Many players immediately raise their hands, knowing they will be given prescription pain killers on the spot. Training staff then walks around handing out unmarked manila envelopes containing several pills. The pain killers given out are typically some type of opioid. Common opioids found in the NFL are Percocet, Vicodin, and OxyContin. Another common practice is the use of power anti-inflammatory drugs. Many players go into game days with injuries and pain that must be overcome. In order to ensure the players can perform on game day, team training staffs often have a designated line for the athletes who will need injections that day. The two most common drugs used as pregame prophylactics to deaden pain are Cortisone and Toradol. Team doctors will give these injections to any player who thinks they need it on that day. However, often times players are unaware of the consequences of the drugs they are taking. For example, it is recommended that Toradol not be used for any longer than five days as it has serious effects on blood clotting and puts enormous strain on the kidneys. Prolonged use drastically increases the chances for renal failure and can result in a myriad of health complications. Unfortunately, NFL doctors have turned a blind eye to this and regularly give players Toradol throughout the duration of their careers. In an interview with the Washington Post, ex-offensive lineman Rex Hadnot explained that training staffs from four different NFL teams gave him Toradol injections or pills once a week for nine years without ever addressing the possible side-effects. “Sometimes,” he said, “I got the shot and the pill. ” In general, team physicians do not explain to their players everything that comes along with using prescription pain killers or anti-inflammatory drugs. Several NFL players have spoken up about these practices. In an interview with VICE Sports, ex-player Kyle Turley explained, “When you hear a doctor that’s got all these credentials and accolades and he’s the team doctor in the National Football League, you tend to believe him. ” Without adequate medical knowledge, players must depend on and trust their team doctor’s recommendations. This leaves players in a vulnerable position as their interests do not necessarily line up with that of the training staff. As a result, many players have been left to deal with the repercussions of illegitimate medical practices after their careers with no aid from the league. 

Problems with opioids
Opioids are a family of drugs including the illicit substance heroin as well as illicit prescription pain relievers including, most notably, oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, morphine, and fentanyl . Most individuals consume opioids for their pain-relieving effects and the temporary state of euphoria they induce. However, these benefits come at the cost of their addictive nature. Addiction has been defined as a primary, chronic, and relapsing brain disease characterized by an individual pathologically pursuing reward and/or relief by substance use and other behaviors. According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, of the 20.5 million Americans 12 or older that had substance use disorder in 2015, 2 million were abusing prescription pain killers and another 591,000 were abusing heroin. Furthermore, of the 52,404 lethal drug overdoses in 2015, 20,101 were related to prescription pain relievers while 12,990 were related to heroin use. Besides their highly addictive qualities, opioids are also associated with a significantly increased risk of hypoxemia. Hypoxemia refers to having a below-normal level of oxygen in the blood, particularly in the arteries. In a study done at the State University of New York at Buffalo, researchers found that patients undergoing opiate therapy for chronic pain have an extremely high rate of sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoxemia . Symptoms include confusion, cough, shortness of breath, fast heart rate, rapid breathing and others. In severe cases, damage to the brain, liver, and other organs can occur only minutes after symptoms appear. Another major concern surrounding the use of opioids is the increased risk of developing clinical depression. One study concluded that “the risk of development of depression increased as the rate of opioid analgesic exposure increased. ” Researchers found that patients who took opioids for 90-180 days increased their risk of developing depression by 25%, and those who continued opioid treatment for more than 180 days increased their risk by 53%. The mechanisms by which opioids are linked to depression are still unclear, however, researchers believe it may have to do with the tampering of the brain’s reward pathway. They hypothesize that “chronic use of opioids may raise the threshold for an individual to experience pleasure from natural rewards, such as food and sex. ” 
These adverse side effects are all particularly concerning for NFL players. A 2010 study conducted at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis found that retired NFL players misuse opioids at a rate more than three times that of the general population . 644 retired NFL players were surveyed. 52% of the respondents stated they had used opioids during their NFL careers with 71% admitting misuse. Moreover, 15% of misusers had presently been misusing versus 5% of those who used the opioids as they were prescribed during their careers. Multivariate analyses revealed three indicators that were associated with increased likelihood of abusing prescription pain relievers: severity of NFL pain, degree of mental impairment, and recent heavy drinking. Interestingly, undiagnosed concussions was a single predictor of current misuse vs. non-use. Players exposed to opioids during their careers are at a much higher risk of continuing opioid use and living with the subsequent side effects. Dan Johnson, former tight end for the Miami Dolphins, became addicted to prescription pain relievers after two surgeries required as a result of injuries he suffered during his career. He explained during an interview with ESPN that he was taking around 1000 Vicodin per month and that it was no exaggeration . His addiction to opioids had him contacting vendors overseas, over the Internet, and through acquaintances. He admitted to contemplating suicide on more than one occasion. Another notable case comes from Keith McCants, former first round NFL draft pick. McCants entered the NFL with an injured leg and was told that he could either have surgery or play through the pain. In an interview with VICE Sports, McCants describes the pressure he felt to take the pain killers in order to perform. He explains, “Game day, we walk in the locker room…You should have seen the people runnin’ to get their Toradol shots. After the game, you got your pills: Percocet, Tylox, Lortab…Cortisone shots, Morphine pills or Morphine shots. Before it was over with, I was consuming over 183 pills per week, not knowing the effects it had on my liver and my kidneys and, more importantly, the development of my split personality with violent tendencies that my family had to deal with. ” Additionally, after being released from the league, McCants was left to deal with his substance dependence that developed over the course of his career. His addiction led to multiple arrests. McCants describes the grim situation from his perspective: “If I go to a doctor and get medication…every time I go to the emergency room…I had no insurance. It was $600,000 out of my pocket. It was more easy to go and get some street drugs or something of that nature after I left the league because it was all I could afford. I wasn’t doing drugs for pleasure. I was just simply out there trying to suppress my pains. ” 
The adverse side effects of prolonged opioid use are very concerning. Team doctors should explain to players all of the potential risks that come with opiate use. Moreover, current pain management practices within the league should be scrutinized and other alternatives should be explored. 
Marijuana as a pain reliever
The problems that can arise from regular opioid therapy for pain management are very concerning. NFL players have the right to know the effects that medications will have on them as well as all options available to them. Marijuana has been used for thousands of years due to its relaxing and therapeutic effects. Users of marijuana, both recreational and medical, often report feelings of euphoria, heightened sensations, and an increased ease in falling asleep. However, there is mounting evidence that marijuana can also be used as an effective pain reliever. Chronic pain typically falls under two categories: nociceptive pain, or pain that is a result of damage to body tissues, and neuropathic pain, or pain that occurs as a result of nerve damage. NFL players are susceptible to both forms of chronic pain due to the high impact nature of their sport. Nociceptive pain is common due to injuries that players suffer throughout the course of their careers and neuropathic pain can develop as a result of brain trauma due to repeated blows to the head. A 2015 review of medical literature on marijuana from 1948 through March 2015 provided some positive insight . The review examined twenty-eight randomized clinical trials of cannabinoids, the active constituents of cannabis, as pharmacotherapy. Of the twenty-eight trials, four were ruled out, six investigated effects on chronic pain, six focused on neuropathic pain, and twelve examined the effects on pain related to muscle spasticity (unusual tightening of the muscles) as a result of multiple sclerosis. Findings indicated that “the use of marijuana for chronic pain, neuropathic pain, and spasticity due to multiple sclerosis is supported by high-quality evidence.” 
	Analyzing studies done on pain relief is difficult as it is tough to develop suitable metrics for the measurement of pain, but taking biochemical measurements after cannabis use is done rather easily. Researchers are still figuring out the exact mechanisms by which marijuana reduces pain, however, there is a general understanding of why its active components elicit therapeutic effects. The reason marijuana benefits so many illnesses and ailments is due to the fact that its active pharmacological ingredients, known as cannabinoids, mimic the Endocannabinoid System (ECS) within the body. The ECS is an internal harm reduction system. It is responsible for keeping our bodies’ fundamental functions such as sleep, appetite, pain recognition, and the immune system in balance as well maintaining overall homeostasis–the ability of the body or a cell to seek and maintain a condition of equilibrium or stability within its internal environment when dealing with external changes . Stress and trauma are responsible for bringing our bodies into disequilibrium. When this occurs, endocannabinoids work to establish balance once again. As it relates to pain, endocannabinoids work through two primary mechanisms. When they bind to endocannabinoid receptors, specific cannabinoids, such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can reduce pain by modulating neurological function to reduce pain signals being sent to the brain from the peripheral nervous system. The other way in which cannabinoids relieve pain is through their powerful anti-inflammatory properties. Inflammation is the body’s defense against foreign organisms and the way in which it protects damaged tissue. It appears when the immune system is stimulated and releases cytokines–small proteins that have a specific effect on the interactions between cells, on the communication between cells, or on the behavior of cells . The vast number of different cannabinoids found in cannabis and the complexity of the endocannabinoid system make it difficult to point to a single mechanism by which cannabinoids reduce inflammation. However, many different studies focusing on inflammation in different parts of the body have found that the presence of cannabinoids tends to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Other evidence suggests that cannabinoids anti-inflammatory properties may stem from its ability to increase the production of eicosanoids which promote the resolution of inflammation . The ability of cannabinoids to reduce inflammation is so powerful that arthritis researchers have been experimenting with a synthetic derivative of a marijuana metabolite as a possible new anti-inflammatory drug .
Unlike opioids, the properties of marijuana actually address the source of the pain rather than simply blocking pain signals. Furthermore, marijuana and its active components do not provoke the same addictive behaviors in users that opioids do. Experts who rate the likelihood of dependence for drugs used for recreational purposes have traditionally placed it at or very close to the bottom of the list. In relation to its addictiveness, marijuana better resembles caffeine than it does nicotine, alcohol, or heroin, although its withdrawal reaction is even less significant than that of caffeine. The primary reason for its low addictive rating comes from the fact that THC is released so slowly from the body that symptoms of withdrawal do not develop. Although more research is necessary to draw sound conclusions, the known benefits of cannabinoids coupled with its virtually non-existent addictive nature provide the foundation for the argument that marijuana should be explored as a viable alternative for pain management. Some may argue the degree to which it can relieve pain is nowhere close to that of powerful opioids. However, Kyle Turley, who became severely addicted to pain killers as a result of his NFL career, is a proponent of legalizing marijuana for medical reasons and stated that he frequently smokes cannabis to relieve career-related pain even though he has a constant supply of prescription pain killers . 
Brain trauma and the NFL
Head injuries have always played a role in football. Severe blows to the head occur on a regular basis and the topic has only recently gotten the recognition it deserves. Concussions are a form of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the immediate and long-term effects of concussions are by no means mild. Immediate symptoms typically involve loss of balance, headache, confusion, memory loss, vision change, mood change, and fatigue. Long-term effects, such as mood disorder, memory loss and depression, come about as a result of the continued degradation of nerve endings due to brain trauma even long after symptoms of concussion have disappeared. Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is also a major concern for NFL players. CTE develops as a result of prolonged exposure to minor brain trauma. It is a progressive degenerative disease that attacks the nerve endings in the brain. Frequent brain trauma causes a buildup of the protein tau which is responsible for the gradual deterioration of nerve endings . Symptoms of CTE often include memory loss, confusion, impaired judgement, paranoia, issues with impulse control, aggression, depression, and progressive dementia.
Cannabinoids and neuroprotection  
There is a growing amount of evidence indicating cannabis can have significant effects on brain health. The powerful cannabinoids present in marijuana may help the brain repair itself after suffering trauma such as a concussion. Many cannabinoids found in marijuana are powerful antioxidants. These antioxidants act as neuroprotectants by preventing stress-related damage and reducing inflammation within the brain. This is done by regulating the buildup of neurotoxins like the protein tau. A 2014 study found that low doses of THC reduced brain swelling in rodent models. The researchers’ findings suggest that low doses of THC protect the brain from neuroinflammation-induced cognitive damage and may be a viable compound for the treatment of neuroinflammatory conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases . The federal government also acknowledges the neuroprotective potential of cannabinoids. In its patent application for non-psychoactive cannabidiol (CBD), it writes, “The cannabinoids [in cannabis] are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage…or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. ” Cannabinoids may have potential for preventative applications as well. In an interview with Fox News, Dean Petkana, CEO of KannaLife Sciences, explained, “We’ve found in preclinical research that CBD acts as a neuroprotectant. So,…we could be using that as a prophylaxis against repetitive concussive injury.” THC might also be a viable option as pretreatment for possible head trauma. A 2014 study found that a positive THC screen was associated with increased rates of survival after suffering a TBI. That is, the study suggests that individuals who have THC in their system have a decreased mortality rate after sustaining a TBI . 
	In an open letter to the NFL commissioner, Dr. Lester Grinspoon, Professor emeritus at Harvard University, writes, “The NFL should pay attention to the fact that we are now pretty confident that cannabis has some qualities about which make it clear that it is neuroprotective. ” Seeing as how the benefits of cannabinoids can be directly applied to the negative effects of brain trauma, the NFL should definitely reconsider if their recently heightened standard for external protection (i.e. helmets, shoulder pads, etc) is enough to keep their players safe, both presently and in their post-NFL lives. 

Marijuana and NFL player arrests
Since January 1, 2014, there have been 14 NFL players arrested for possession of marijuana, as well as a handful of arrests for illegal possession of prescription pain relievers . Player arrests are not a good thing for the athletes, their teams, or the league and should be prevented as much as possible. The nature of professional sports tends to put athletes in the spotlight, especially when something negative occurs. The public examination of player arrests has led to the development of some negative sentiments toward the league. Some people view the NFL as an organization that allows ‘criminals’ to participate in competition. As it relates to marijuana, this sentiment could be put to rest if the league were to remove marijuana from its list of banned substances. Twenty-eight states which host twenty of the thirty-two NFL teams now recognize medical marijuana as legal. If players were allowed to get prescriptions for medical marijuana, they would be much less likely to be arrested for cannabis possession. Additionally, if players start migrating toward marijuana for pain management, they would also be at a lower risk of being charged with illegally possessing prescription opioids. Granted, this is not a something that will fix all of the legal issues that come along with marijuana. There are still some states that have complicated medical marijuana laws and twelve of the thirty-two teams would not benefit from such a rule change. However, if the league’s goal is to provide the best atmosphere for the players and limit the potential for arrests, then this is definitely something to take into consideration.    

Conclusion
Marijuana has been cultivated for thousands of years. It was used by ancient cultures for its calming therapeutic effects and over the past several decades, has been shown to have a multitude of medical benefits. The benefits of marijuana come from the many different cannabinoids found in the herb. Most notably, the cannabinoids act as antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. These benefits are especially important as they are responsible for marijuana’s neuroprotective properties. The neuroprotectants in cannabis could be especially beneficial for NFL players who experience minor to severe head trauma on a regular basis. Furthermore, NFL players are at an increased risk of developing depression due to their exposure to prescription pain killers and high risk of concussion; there is evidence that suggests suffering even a single concussion may triple the risk of long-term suicide . One benefit that was not discussed in this paper was CBD’s potential in being used as a fast-acting anti-depressant . Additionally, if NFL players were able to receive a prescription for medical marijuana, both the athletes and the league could benefit from a reduction of player arrests. There is not a whole lot of evidence citing dangers of marijuana use. Even the owners of NFL teams do not see much wrong in removing marijuana from the league’s banned substance list. However, they plan to use the idea as leverage when negotiating collective bargaining agreements, demanding something of equal value from the players for allowing the use of marijuana. Operating under the assumption that the NFL wants to provide the safest playing environment for its athletes, it should remove marijuana from its banned substance list as it can be used as an effective pain killer, has been shown to have neuroprotective properties, and can provide social and legal benefit to both the league and its athletes.
